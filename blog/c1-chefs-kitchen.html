      Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?
      Dev Bootcamp started as an informal network of people committed to learning and growing in a new direction; it's roots are outgoing and service-oriented.

      What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      My impressions are all positive. I am happy to participate, to lead, and to be able to learn in an environment without pretensions and that aims to fulfill and uplift both students and teachers.

    <p>
      Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?
      I see the program as well structured, rigorous, but approachable whereas my experience as a Computer Science student in 2000 with no experience with computers seemed impossible.

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      Totally excited. I'm not so much nervous as I am psyched to get there and see a slow but steady progression.
